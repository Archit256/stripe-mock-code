Some of the libraries need to be installed in the python setup or python virtual env.

Using a mac? You can use the virtual env
. venv/bin/activate 

Install dependencies in requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt 

Webhook from one terminal
Assuming Stripe cli is installed and logged in - execute
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:4242/stripe-response 
This will generate a code "whsec.." 
Replace this in the getPayment.py file line 15 (endpoint_secret)

python3 -m flask run --port 4242
